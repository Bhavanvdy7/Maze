 Maze VR
Developement process was tough, since It was hard to figure out what is the problem in debugging the unity project from Unity. Had to build and run in android to test. However all the asset worked out well. Still trying to figure out how interactables and intoractor works in Unity with Ray cast.

Aspect like snap prototype and progrid clearly smoothen the progress.
